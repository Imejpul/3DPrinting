Coil4VapingMaker

A friend aproach to me to design a jig for make coils for vaping using the aluminum profile _ as main frame.

I started from some basic designs of clapton jig from [cults3d](https://cults3d.com/es/modelo-3d/herramientas/quitavueltas-resistencias-vapeo-608) so I have developed all the idea from there.

I desingned all the jig to use it with the Bosch drill model PSR 14,4 LI-2 (the drill that my friend owns)

The tolerances of the holes for aluminum profile are very tight so make sure your printer is well calibrated enough.
