Coil4VapingMaker

A friend approached me to design a rig for make coils for vaping using an old Bosch 40 series aluminum profile(40 x 80 mm) as main frame [IndiaMart.com](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/aluminum-extrusions-20912135391.html), check detail picture in this repo to find out which one was used.

I started from some basic designs of clapton jig from [cults3d](https://cults3d.com/es/modelo-3d/herramientas/quitavueltas-resistencias-vapeo-608) so I have developed all the idea from there.

I desingned all the rig to use it with the Bosch drill model PSR 14,4 LI-2 (the drill that my friend owns)

The tolerances of the holes for aluminum profile are very tight so make sure your printer is well calibrated.

Please refer the detailed pictures to better understand the design!
