CellPhone holder Power Bank attachment

I designed this piece to hold a power bank with Velcro on my cellphone holder for my motorcycle
so I don't need a wiring through the motorcycle chassis from the battery to my handlebar to charge my cell phone while I'm riding.

Check the detail picture to view the kind of assembly made.
