CBR 600 F2 Triple Clamp Cover / Holder

I was very disappointed with the solutions provided by the market to hold my cellphone on my motorcycle and also my triple clamp was in bad shape, so I decided to design and print this piece to kill two birds with one shot.

The model of my motorcycle is a Honda CBR 600 F2.
