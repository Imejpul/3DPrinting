Wood Platform Base

This piece was created to create a custom platform on my 3D printer table. It provides more stability  puting it together with a wooden board allowing to store some 3D related things as a plus..

It uses a bolt (Metric - M4) plus its nut to keep the height position (You need to drill the leg).

You can find the leg used here: https://www.leroymerlin.es/fp/15939861/pata-fija-de-acero-negro-70-cm
