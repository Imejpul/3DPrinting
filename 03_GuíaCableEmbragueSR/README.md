Yamaha SR 250 Clutch Cable Guide

I needed a guide piece to my old Yamaha motorcycle clutch cable so I designed this piece. It has to be attached in left front end bars with bolts and nuts built into the close piece.

Check the detail picture to see what it looks like when it is placed on the motorcycle!
