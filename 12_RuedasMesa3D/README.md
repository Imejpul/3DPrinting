Wheel Adaptor

Chair office wheel adaptor to steel leg. This is I use on my custom table to hold my 3D printer and be able to move it around if I need that.

You should print this piece with a good reinforcement (>40% infill and "Gyroid" infill type is what I used)

You can find the leg used here: https://www.leroymerlin.es/fp/15939861/pata-fija-de-acero-negro-70-cm
