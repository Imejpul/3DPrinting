Knee Slider holder

It is my slider holder for knee for motorcycle rides.


This design is one my most used 3D printed objects which actually gives me a good opportunity to solve the knee problem in curves wearing Kevlar jeans and not a leather suit for occasional rides.


It is reinforced to give full strength in many directions but to give flexibility when It is need.
